An interperter which works on a subset of javascript including booleans and numbers. It is written in typescript and is probably one of my favorite projects of all time. 
The intepreter works on arithmetic expressions and boolean expressions as well as if- else and while loops it was written in my freshman year of college. 
I want to try to redo this project and see if I can make my own syntax and cover strings and more complex types and data structures maybe make a compiler rather than an interpreter next time.
